# Manual Testing of gradle-clojure

This project is set up using Gradle's [composite build](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html) allow testing against your local copy of gradle-clojure.

This is helpful to avoid needing to publish somewhere to try this in a test project.

Just run this like any other Gradle project and it will pull in the latest plugin.

NOTE: This still seems to be a little flakey, but it's an option.
